## But what if our models don't make sense?

---

## Traditional modelling

Traditionally, empirical modelling has a singular goal:
- To estimate, using a range of soil properties (and spectra), a single soil property
- But what if our prediction doesn't make sense?
- If we get a pH of 4, the soil probably isn't high in $\rm{CaCO_{3}}$

## What are we going to do about it?

---

## We think like scientists

- Predictions aren't valuable if they conflict with existing knowledge
- NIR spectra offer an opportunity
 - From one set of predictors, we can

## What benefit is this really going to offer?

- Emulation of some aspects of the scientific process
