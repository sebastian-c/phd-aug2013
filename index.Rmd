## What's already out there?

---

## Empirical models

- All pedotransfer functions involving carbon
- Carbon spatial models
 - SSURGO

---

## Mechanistic models

- Often work with carbon pools
 - Roth C

---

## NIR spectra

- Light in 350-2500nm range
- Quick to measure

---

## How NIR is used

- Primarily in empirical models
 - Multiple linear regression
 - Boosted regression trees
 - Partial Least Squares
 - Principal Component Regression

---

## Problems

- All narrow in their focus
- No internal validation
 - If a prediction is off in obvious ways, it remains so

--- .shout

## The solution?

---

## Science!

- Compare what we predict against what we know
 - If we get a low pH, we probably don't also have high calcium carbonate
- Hence get models that mimic the scientific process
- Should combine both empirical and mechanistic approaches

--- .shout

## So what are you planning?

---

## 3 step process

- Use Cubist and MCMC to generate empirical starting values
 - From NIR spectra from US projects
- Use mechanistic models on empirical results
- Predict carbon in Australia for the next 30 years
