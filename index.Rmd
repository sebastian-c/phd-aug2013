## What's already out there?

---

## Empirical models

- All pedotransfer functions involving carbon
- Carbon spatial models
 - SSURGO

---

## Mechanistic models

- Work with carbon pools
 - Roth C
 - Century

---

## NIR spectra

- Light in 350-2500nm range
- Quick and cheap to measure
 - Relative to lab analysis

---

## How NIR is used

- Primarily in empirical models
 - Multiple linear regression
 - Boosted regression trees
 - Partial Least Squares
 - Principal Component Regression

---

## Problems

- All narrow in their focus
- No internal validation
 - If a prediction is off in obvious ways, it remains so

--- .shout

## The solution?

---

## Project aims

- Generate empirical model to predict SOC from carbon
 - Use this model for cheap NIR: Quick easy sampling
 -
