  title = {Near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopic techniques
	for assessing the amount of carbon stock in soils – Critical review
	and research perspectives},

  abstract = {This paper is an extensive review of the research that has been undertaken
	on near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy applied
	to soil particularly for determining carbon (C) content. The objective
	is to determine which acquisition method (NIR, MIR, in the field
	or in the laboratory) might be recommended for the purpose of C stock
	measurement with a particular interest in carbon credit trading.
	For this purpose, an optimal method has to satisfy the dual constraints
	of low-cost and high throughput analysis. The various methods proposed
	in the literature are compared. In order to make comparisons as reliable
	as possible, special attention has been paid to the conditions of
	data acquisition (sample preparation), and to calibration and validation
	procedures. In particular, whether the validation has been carried
	out on fully independent samples or on samples similar to the ones
	of the calibration set greatly influences the results. Also, for
	C stock measurement, it is absolutely necessary to measure the bias
	of the prediction in order to be conclusive about the feasibility
	of the method. However, only few researchers provide this parameter
	and we recommend including it as a matter of course in future reports.
	Finally, although MIR on dried and ground samples is the most accurate
	method, on-the-go and in-field sensors provide predictions accurate
	enough to show promise in being a valuable component of technologies
	that would be used for C-credit purposes. But in order to meet the
	cost/accuracy trade-off, the main issue using such field sensors
	is to be able to simultaneously measure the bulk density or, better,
	to directly measure the volumetric concentration of C in soil. This
	circumvents the costs of field extraction and laboratory analysis.
	This is the next great challenge to be met by soil scientists.},

  review = {MIR vs NIR
	
	- MIR is more precise for finding carbonates
	
	- MIR is generally better than MIR
	
	
	NIR
	
	- The 1650-2500nm range is best for finding Org C
	
	- Measurements of fresh soil can give satisfying results (RPD from
	1.45 to over 3)
	
	- Bulk density is difficult to predict
	
	
	Bias
	
	- Many papers use R^2 and RPD which are dependent on the range and
	distribution of the data
